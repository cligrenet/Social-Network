# Social Network

## About

### What is it?

Social Network is a Twitter-like website for making posts and following users.

### Why I did this?

-   Get familiar with Django framework
-   Practice data modeling, backend routes, implement methods to handle CRUDs
-   A taste of user authentication (register, login, logout) and pagination using Django Paginator class and Bootstrap Pagination features
-   Make API calls using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

### Technically

This small project uses Django as backend framework, (Django integrated) SQLite as database and Django templates as client-side views.
